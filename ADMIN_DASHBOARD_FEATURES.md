# Admin Dashboard Features - Reservation Management

## 🎛️ **New Admin Control Features**

The admin dashboard now includes comprehensive controls for managing reservation notes and deposit settings.

## 📊 **Reservation Details View**

### **Enhanced Information Display**

The reservation details page now shows:

#### **Transfer Payment Information**
- **Transfer Amount**: Shows the amount transferred by the guest
- **Transfer Date**: When the transfer was made
- **Transfer Receipt**: Link to view uploaded receipt image
- **Deposit Requirements**: Fixed amount and/or percentage requirements
- **Admin Notes**: Notes visible to both admin and guest

#### **Deposit Status Tracking**
- **Verified**: Green badge when deposit is verified
- **Pending**: Yellow badge when transfer uploaded but not verified
- **None**: Gray badge when no transfer provided

## 🎯 **Admin Control Forms**

### **1. Admin Notes & Deposit Settings Form**

**Location**: Reservation details page → "Admin Notes & Deposit Settings" section

**Fields Available:**
- **Admin Notes** (Textarea): Add/edit notes visible to guests
- **Minimum Deposit Amount** (Number): Set fixed deposit requirement

**Usage Examples:**
```
Admin Notes: "Please send 50% deposit to confirm your reservation"
Minimum Deposit Amount: 5000
Deposit Percentage: 50
```

**Priority Logic:**
1. If `minimum_deposit_amount` is set, it takes priority
2. If only `deposit_percentage` is set, it calculates from total amount
3. If neither is set, no deposit required

**Location**: Reservation details page → "Deposit Verification" section

**When Visible:**
